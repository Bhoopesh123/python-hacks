# python-hacks for enabling logging in your Python Code
This module defines functions and classes which implement a flexible event logging system for applications and libraries.

The key benefit of having the logging API provided by a standard library module is that all Python modules can participate in logging, so your application log can include your own messages integrated with messages from third-party modules.

Let's run few examples to understand the logging

    cd examples
    python3 myapp.py
    python3 logging_example2.py
    python3 logging_example3.py
    python3 logging_example4.py
    python3 logging_example5.py
